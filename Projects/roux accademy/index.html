        <h2>Victor Stuesse wins Lacie Award</h2>
        <p>Victor Stuesse is the recipient of this year’s Lacie Award, dedicated to honoring the work of a professor who has touched lives both inside and outside of the Roux community. As a teacher, Professor Stuesse has ushered over 900 students through the Craft + Design program, and has always been willing to share the secrets of his craft. As a sculptor and restorer, he has donated his time to public works projects such as the Central Park Arts Maintenance Council and the Metropolitan Museum’s docent program.</p>
        
        <p>Professor Stuesse has had a long and successful career in the arts, having received many commissions over the years in cities from Chicago to Bangkok, but always returns to “the job I call a dream.” For his dedication to teaching and community involvement, the Roux Academy is proud to award him with this year’s prize, which also includes a stipend for pursuit of personal projects outside the academy. Congratulations, Professor Stuesse!</p>
